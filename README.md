An inventory application for printed materials 

Link to live page:  https://booked-inventory-app.herokuapp.com/

## Motivation
I wanted to make an application for my friend who runs a small bookstore. He would write inventory on paper,
which is why I decided he needed something a little more efficient. Though the main purpose of this application
is for a store, it can also be used for private collections of books.
